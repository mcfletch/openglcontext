The OpenGLContext project has a number of applicable licenses. 
The majority of the code, and all core functionality is released
under the OpenGLContext License (below).

Exceptions are as follows:

	The (unfinished) module fxcontext.py is released under the 
	LGPL, and is only required and/or loaded if you use the 
	Fox/FxPy GUI library.  This module is an extremely loose
	interpretation of the FxPy gltest.py module.  Basically only
	the approach and necessary calls were taken from that module.
	
	The dek_texturesurf demo is covered under the PyOpenGL 1.5.5
	license.  See PyOpenGL's license for details.
	
	The NeHe demos and supporting media files are (c)2000 Jeff
	Molofee, see files for details.
	
	The redbook demos are Copyright (c) 1993-1999, Silicon 
	Graphics, Inc., see files for details.
	
	The obj loading module is derived from a module which is:
		Copyright (c) 2006-2008 Alex Holkner

	see files for details.

	The GLSL shaders from the OpenGL Shading Language (2nd Ed)
	are:
