"""Event classes and event-processing mechanisms

This package defines a set of "local" event classes which are
to be used by client applications.  These include keyboard,
keypress, mousebutton and mousemove events.  The package also
defines a set of modules which translated from GUI events/
callbacks to the local event classes.  Finally, the package
provides mix in functionality for contexts to provide event
handling callback registration.
