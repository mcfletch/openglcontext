	<h1 class="title">Shadows with ARB Shadow</h1>
	<div class="paragraph">
	<img src="shadow_1.py-screen-0001.png" alt="Screenshot" class=" wiki" />
</div>
	<div class="paragraph">In this tutorial, we will:</div>
	<ul class="">
	<li class="">setup basic ARB_shadow-based shadow-rendering</li>
	<li class="">render geometry into the "back buffer" depth-buffer</li>
	<li class="">copy the depth-buffer into a depth-texture image</li>
	<li class="">use the depth-texture to filter a multi-pass renderer</li>
</ul>
	<div class="paragraph">The ARB Shadow extension allows you to use a "depth-texture"
(provided by the ARB_depth_texture extension) as a lookup table 
to filter your rendering passes in such a way as to simulate 
shadows.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">The shadowed render operates in three passes for a single light,
with an extra 2 passes for each extra shadow-casting light you 
would like to add.  However, while we do not do it within this 
tutorial, you can cache partial solutions for first rendering pass 
so that you only need to render "non-static" geometry again for 
each rendering pass (though this requires an extra depth texture).</div>
	<div class="paragraph">The process works as follows:</div>
	<ul class="">
	<li class="">render your scene from the point-of-view of your light with just     the depth-buffer being updated</li>
	<li class="">copy the depth-buffer into a depth texture as a lookup table</li>
	<li class="">render your scene with just ambient light </li>
	<li class="">render your scene with diffuse/specular light using the lookup     table and a per-fragment alpha filter to determine which fragments     are "shadowed"</li>
</ul>
	<div class="paragraph">Most confusion during the process comes during the creation of a matrix 
which maps the eye-space of the camera (render pass 3) into the eye-space 
of the light (render pass 1).  The actual calculations are simple, but 
knowing in which order to combine the matrices can be confusing.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">This tutorial follows roughly after 
	<a href="http://www.paulsprojects.net/tutorials/smt/smt.html" class="">this C tutorial</a>
with alterations to work with OpenGLContext and a few different 
choices with regard to attempts to minimize artefacts in the shadows.

the texture, so you can use a depth texture without needing to figure 
out in which format your depth texture happens to be.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Depth texture sizes can have an extremely large effect on the quality 
of the shadows produced.  If your texture only has a couple of dozen 
pixels covering a particular piece of geometry then the shadows on that 
piece of geometry are going to be extremely pixelated.  This is
particularly so if your light has a wide-angle cutoff, as the more of the 
scene that is rendered into the texture, the smaller each object appears 
in the buffer.

	<div class="paragraph">We want to avoid depth-buffer artefacts where the front-face 
appears to be ever-so-slightly behind itself due to multiplication
and transformation artefacts.  The original tutorial uses 
rendering of the *back* faces of objects into the depth buffer,
but with "open" geometry such as the Utah Teapot, we wind up with 
nasty artefacts where e.g. the area on the body around the spout 
isn't shadowed because there's no back-faces in front of it.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Even with the original approach, using a polygon offset will tend 
to avoid "moire" effects in the shadows where precision issues 
cause the depths in the buffer to pass back and forth across the 
LEQUAL threshold as they cross the surface of the object.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">To avoid these problems, we use a polygon-offset operation.  
The first 1.0 gives us the raw fragment depth-value, the 
second 1.0, the parameter "units" says to take 1.0 
depth-buffer units and add it to the depth-value 
from the previous step, making the depth buffer record values 
1.0 units less than the geometry's natural value.
