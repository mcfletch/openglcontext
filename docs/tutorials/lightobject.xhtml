This tutorial creates a simple scenegraph that includes a number 
of light nodes that demonstrate some of the VRML97 light properties 
that OpenGLContext makes available.  It also demonstrates basic 
use of ROUTEs to create simple animations of properties within the 
scenegraph.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Note that the legacy OpenGL lighting model described here can be 
replaced when using shader-based geometry.

of pi to some reasonable accuracy (from numpy).</div>

the whole tutorial is accomplished with scenegraph nodes, rather than 
raw OpenGL rendering.</div>

with rotating lighting in three colours."""
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">Each of the light types defined in VRML97 is going to be 
        defined for this tutorial.  Each of these lights includes 
        color, intensity, ambientIntensity and attenuation fields.
        These are pretty much passed directly into the underlying 
        (default) OpenGL lighting model.  The lights also have an 
        "on" field for turning them on/off.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">The DirectionalLight class represents the simplest type of 
Light.  It is an "infinitely far off" light which sends 
rays in parallel throughout the entire scene along its 
"direction" vector.  It resembles the light cast by the 
sun as seen on the surface of the Earth.
</div>
</div>
	<div class="code-sample">        dl = DirectionalLight(
            direction = (-10,-10,0),

        )
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">The PointLight is a slightly more complex light.  It is 
        a "point emitter", similar to an unshielded lightbulb or 
        candle, which sends rays out in all directions.  As such it 
        does not have a "direction" vector, but does have a location 
        vector.</div>
</div>
	<div class="code-sample">        pl = PointLight(
            location = (-2,2,2),
            color=(1,0,0),
            radius = 3,
        )
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">The SpotLight is the most complex light.  It resembles a 
        stage spotlight with a shield that restricts the light emitted 
        to a cone which is rooted at the light's location with "beamWidth" 
        angle.</div>

	<div class="paragraph">Here's where we define the key-frames for our animations.  
        The first animation defines a simple Orientation (rotation)
        around the Y-axis.  The second defines a "bounce" from 
        .25 to 1.0 to .25.  Note that we again define DEF values so 
        that we can reference the node easily in the future.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">The Timer node is what will generate the events we'll be using 
to perform the animation.  Here we say that it will take 3.0s
to complete a single cycle and that it will loop indefinitely 
(a value of 1 means loop indefinitely, larger integers will loop 
a specified number of times, 0 means do not loop).
