This tutorial creates a simple scenegraph that includes a number
of light nodes that demonstrate some of the VRML97 light properties
that OpenGLContext makes available.  It also demonstrates basic
use of ROUTEs to create simple animations of properties within the
scenegraph.</div>
	<div class="paragraph indent-level-0">Note that the legacy OpenGL lighting model described here can be
replaced when using shader-based geometry.</div>

BaseContext = testingcontext.getInteractive()

of pi to some reasonable accuracy (from numpy).</div>

the whole tutorial is accomplished with scenegraph nodes, rather than
raw OpenGL rendering.</div>

	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph indent-level-0">Each of the light types defined in VRML97 is going to be
        defined for this tutorial.  Each of these lights includes
        color, intensity, ambientIntensity and attenuation fields.
        These are pretty much passed directly into the underlying
        (default) OpenGL lighting model.  The lights also have an
        "on" field for turning them on/off.</div>
	<div class="paragraph indent-level-8">The DirectionalLight class represents the simplest type of
Light.  It is an "infinitely far off" light which sends
rays in parallel throughout the entire scene along its
"direction" vector.  It resembles the light cast by the
sun as seen on the surface of the Earth.</div>

	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph indent-level-0">The PointLight is a slightly more complex light.  It is
        a "point emitter", similar to an unshielded lightbulb or
        candle, which sends rays out in all directions.  As such it
        does not have a "direction" vector, but does have a location
        vector.</div>

        )
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph indent-level-0">The SpotLight is the most complex light.  It resembles a
        stage spotlight with a shield that restricts the light emitted
        to a cone which is rooted at the light's location with "beamWidth"
        angle.</div>

	<div class="paragraph indent-level-0">Here's where we define the key-frames for our animations.
        The first animation defines a simple Orientation (rotation)
        around the Y-axis.  The second defines a "bounce" from
        .25 to 1.0 to .25.  Note that we again define DEF values so
        that we can reference the node easily in the future.</div>
	<div class="paragraph indent-level-8">The Timer node is what will generate the events we'll be using
to perform the animation.  Here we say that it will take 3.0s
to complete a single cycle and that it will loop indefinitely

a specified number of times, 0 means do not loop).</div>
